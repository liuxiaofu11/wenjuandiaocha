# Introduction - idea

- At the beginning of 2019, a colleague wanted to do a photo data collection campaign across the country. After investigation, he used a saas tool: [*Customer Form];

- Due to the large amount of data, some business components and attachment storage costs of the saas tool were high (for me); and the content collected had high privacy requirements, which could not be met by the saas tool at that time. Considering security and cost issues, I started planning my own form system.

- I visited the open source community and found that there were few open source form systems in China at that time, or they did not meet our pursuit of “beauty”. So I planned to use my spare time to write a questionnaire form system and start from open source. tduck form was born.

- At the end of 2019, the emergence of “COVID-19” raised the demand for questionnaire form systems to another level. We enabled enterprises and institutions to have a low-cost and fast independent deployment form questionnaire system by continuously optimizing it.

- Open source version After 2 years of optimization, the function tends to be stable; tduck-Pro commercial version was launched in the second half of 2021.
